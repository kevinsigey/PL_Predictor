# Public, password-gated PL Predictor deployment — one image serving the
# built React frontend and the FastAPI backend from a single process/origin
# (see api/main.py's StaticFiles mount and api/auth.py's GuestAuthMiddleware).
# The private/full app (npm run dev + uvicorn --reload, no PUBLIC_MODE) is
# untouched by this file — it's only used for the public deployment.

# Dependencies FIRST, keyed on pyproject.toml and requirements-lock.txt alone. The dependency layer is large (xgboost, pandas, scipy,
# scikit-learn) and used to sit AFTER `COPY src/`, so every commit rebuilt it with a new digest and the VPS kept a
# full extra copy per deploy. Now an unchanged dependency set reuses the SAME layer digest across commits and a deploy
# adds only the thin app layers.
# `pip install -e .` needs the package directory to exist to resolve it, so a stub stands in for the real source;
# the real source is copied right after and PYTHONPATH=/app/src (set below) is what the app imports from.
COPY pyproject.toml requirements-lock.txt ./
# Editable install, matching local dev exactly (README's own `pip install -e
# . -c requirements-lock.txt`) — NOT a cosmetic choice: config.py derives
# PROJECT_ROOT (and everything under it: MODELS_DIR, CACHE_DIR,
# FRONTEND_DIST_DIR) from `Path(__file__).resolve().parents[2]`. A
# non-editable install copies the package into site-packages, so that
# math would resolve to somewhere under site-packages instead of /app —
# silently breaking every path in the app (confirmed the hard way: the
# first deploy attempt served the API's plain JSON root instead of the
# built frontend, because FRONTEND_DIST_DIR pointed nowhere real).
# Pinned to this project's own known-working versions rather than an
# unconstrained install, to avoid a newer pandas/xgboost/etc. silently
# changing behavior in the one environment nobody develops against directly.

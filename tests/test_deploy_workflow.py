"""A merge to main must deploy to the VPS, and nothing else should.

`deploy-azure.yml` was `workflow_dispatch`-only and had no VPS job at all, so a
merge deployed nothing: every deploy was a manual image build plus a hand-run
`bin/deploy`. This pins the replacement, because the failure mode it guards is
silent -- a workflow that does not run looks exactly like a workflow with nothing
to deploy.

Three things here are not obvious and are the reason the test exists:

* **The paths filter is a whitelist**, so excluding the file the scheduled
  snapshot job commits is implicit. That job runs every 20 minutes through the
  match window, so nothing stops someone adding `data/**` and turning every
  refresh into a deploy. The exclusion is asserted directly instead of trusted
  to the filter's shape, and `test_every_scheduled_commit_is_deliberately_classified`
  walks the OTHER workflows in the repo, finds what they `git add`, and fails on
  any overlap that has not been classified with a reason.

* **The GHCR credential is `GITHUB_TOKEN`, and only because the package is
  linked.** `ghcr.io/kevinsigey/pl-predictor` is a *user-scoped* package; if it is
  not associated with this repository, `GITHUB_TOKEN` may not write to it and the
  push dies with `denied: permission_denied: write_package` **after** the image
  has already built and tagged correctly. NFL and CFB both lost their first VPS
  deploy exactly that way. Linking is a one-time action in package settings with
  no API, so nothing in CI can tell -- the assertion below encodes a fact about
  the outside world, and says how to re-check it:

      gh api /user/packages/container/pl-predictor --jq '.repository.full_name'

  `Kevocado/PL_Predictor` -- linked, GITHUB_TOKEN is correct.
  `null`             -- unlinked; the workflow must switch to `secrets.GHCR_PAT`
                        (already a secret on this repo) AND this check must be
                        rewritten to expect that, in the same commit.

* **Azure is gated with `== 'true'`, not `!= 'false'`.** The failing-open form
  turns Azure back on for any repo that has not set the variable. This is legacy
  infrastructure being cut over, so it has to fail closed.

Two structural checks exist because a text-based guard cannot see YAML
structure. `check_yaml_parses` proves the file is valid YAML at all -- a merge
should not be the first place that is discovered -- and `check_yaml_shape`
covers the specific bug that got through every text assertion in a sibling repo:
steps re-indented by two spaces, which *parses* as a continuation of the
preceding step and silently nests the whole Azure job under one entry.

Every check below is also run against a deliberately broken copy of the file to
prove it can fail. A workflow guard that passes vacuously is worse than no
guard, because it is trusted.

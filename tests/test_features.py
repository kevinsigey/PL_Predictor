    `xg_form.latest_xg_form` documents that it returns an empty frame "if
    Understat data wasn't available". `build_row` did neither: with no xG at all,
    `xg_league_avg` was an empty Series, so `.get(stat_col)` returned `None`
    rather than NaN, the cold-start blend propagated that `None` into `row`, and
    the xG-delta loop two lines later evaluated it:

        TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for -: 'float' and 'NoneType'

    That is a 500 on the live fixtures path for any deployment whose Understat
    fetch is cold, blocked, or has changed schema.

    The follow-up fix made it NaN, on the reasoning that NaN is honest and XGBoost
    consumes it natively. That reasoning was wrong about the second half: the NaN
    never reached XGBoost, because the serving path
    (`ml_scoreline.MLScorelineModel.predict`) ends in `.fillna(0)`. So every cold
    xG column was still served as `0.0` -- asserting the team created exactly zero
    expected goals, and (worse, via the deltas) that it scored exactly to
    expectation. A loud 500 had become a quiet wrong number.

    So the requirement is stronger than "does not raise" and stronger than "is
    NaN": the value has to be a real number that means something. The league's
    expected-goals rate is that value -- it says "unmeasurable right now, league
    average is the best estimate" instead of asserting zero. The delta then
    becomes goals-minus-league-expectation, a genuine over/under-performance
    reading rather than a flat 0.0.

    Asserted against the rate derived from `matches_df` itself, not a hardcoded
    constant. `float('nan') - float('nan')` is `nan`, so the delta columns are

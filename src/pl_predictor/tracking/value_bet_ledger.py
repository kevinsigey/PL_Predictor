"""value_bet_ledger.py — SQLite persistence for the live value-bet track
record: did the fixtures actually flagged as "Value bet" in the app go on
to be profitable, not just whether the model's calibration looks fine in
the abstract?

Same honesty discipline as `tracking/store.py`'s match-prediction ledger: one
counted row per `(event_id, market)`, keyed on the id exactly as that store now
keys its own counted picks — every flagged (fixture, market) pair is
snapshotted once, the first time
`odds/value_bets.py::build_value_bet_table` flags it — including the raw
bookmaker price at that moment, not just the de-vigged implied probability
used for edge detection, since price is what a real bet actually pays out
on — then reconciled against the real result once the match finishes.
Never re-flagged or recomputed after the fact.

Unlike `evaluate/backtest.py`'s synthetic held-out-season replay (one bet
per fixture — the single largest edge, since home/draw/away are mutually
exclusive outcomes of the same event), this tracks *every* flag the app
actually surfaced to the user, including cases where two independent
markets on the same fixture (e.g. home_win and under_2_5) were both
flagged — that's the honest question this answers: are the recommendations
actually shown to the user valuable, not "what's the single best bet per
match." The P&L simulation itself (staking, bankroll accounting) reuses
`penaltyblog.backtest.Account` directly and the same tenth-Kelly default as
the offline backtest, so the two numbers are directly comparable."""

    only (a pending flag is an open position, not a result); the return is
    `get_value_bet_track_record`'s replay under the ledger's default
    staking (tenth-Kelly, the same rule as the offline backtest), reported

    all-pending ledger reads as "nothing to grade yet" rather than a
    fabricated 0%. Averages and the return describe slightly different
    subsets — the replay skips prices above its max-odds cutoff — so
    `n_staked` travels with the return to keep that visible.

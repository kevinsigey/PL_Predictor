"""public_snapshot.py — precomputes everything the public, password-gated
deployment needs to serve, so that deployment never has to run this
project's live-serving feature pipeline itself (Elo/Pi replay, rolling
form, xG, shot-situation, the whole `FixtureFeatureContext` build).
Confirmed live: doing that computation on Render's free tier climbs to its
512MB memory ceiling within minutes and gets OOM-killed — this app's live
state just doesn't fit in a resource-constrained host's budget.

Run this locally (full resources, your own machine, same as retraining)
whenever you want to refresh what the public site shows:

    python -m pl_predictor.public_snapshot

Then commit + push `data/public_snapshot.json` — Render's next deploy picks
it up automatically. See `api/routes.py`'s `PUBLIC_MODE` branches (each
guarded by a `if PUBLIC_MODE:` at the top of the function) for where it's
read back instead of computing live.

Deliberately scoped to only what the public frontend actually calls
(Fixtures list + detail, Data Hub, FPL) — not a snapshot of the whole app's API
surface. The Model page's `/api/manifest` already just reads
`models/manifest.json` directly (no heavy computation involved), so it
needs no snapshot entry; same for the admin-only endpoints, which are
hard-blocked in PUBLIC_MODE regardless (see `routes.py::_admin_only`).
`post_match` and player-review both depend on tracking_store history,
which the public deployment never accumulates itself (background tracking
is skipped entirely in PUBLIC_MODE) — but this script runs locally, where
that history *does* exist, so both get computed here and baked into the
snapshot rather than left out.

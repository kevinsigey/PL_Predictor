"""Shared 1x2 outcome/draw-agreement logic.

Draws are structurally suppressed in the marginal 1x2 probabilities --
summed over the whole scoreline grid, there are always far more non-draw
cells than draw ones, so draw's marginal probability rarely tops the
argmax even when the single most likely individual scoreline genuinely is
a draw (e.g. "1-1" at 11% can still beat every other single cell while
marginal draw sits under 30%, below both marginal home_win and away_win).

`draw_agreement`/`predicted_result` capture this: the scoreline model (top
scoreline) and the 1x2 percentage model "agree" on a draw when the top
scoreline is a draw AND marginal draw probability clears a threshold --
i.e. the percentage model gave a draw real, non-trivial weight, not just
a coincidental near-tie. This is the single definition of that agreement,
shared by pre-match display (`api/schemas.py`) and post-match accuracy
(`tracking/store.py`) so both surfaces always agree with each other.

 * answer, so it has to be the largest thing on the surface — and the tile's job
 * is the *comparison* between the model and the market, which is why `sub` sits
 * under the figure rather than above it. A tile that showed only the model's
 * number would be a vanity metric.
 *
 * A tile whose market the facts do not carry renders **nothing at all**: no
 * dashed box, no zero, no placeholder. Spec §6 says an absent market renders
 * nothing, and a dash would read as "we looked and there is nothing here", which
 * is a different claim from "there is no such market".

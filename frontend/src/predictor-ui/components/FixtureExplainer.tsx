/** FixtureExplainer — the panel, three states.
 *
 *  The default state is the facts plus the flow: the instant block above (timing,
 *  verdict, tiles, bar, record) and, under it, an instant local description built
 *  from what the site already has, with no request made. The AI summary is behind
 *  a button, so nothing is spent until a reader asks. When the button's request
 *  resolves, the summary swaps in over a block and a flow that never unmount —
 *  there is no frame in which the panel is empty. When the request fails, the
 *  facts and the flow are still on screen and the button offers a retry.
 *
 *  The block and the flow are always mounted. They are the states that are always
 *  true, and keeping them mounted is what "the flow does not flicker away" means:
 *  the summary appears above them, not instead of them after a gap.

 *  summary state keeps them; a site with nothing to draw passes nothing and
 *  the summary renders bare. Every field is optional for exactly that reason.
 *
 *  `segments` does double duty: it draws the bar, and it is what the answer's
 *  pick is joined against. The service words a pick in its own vocabulary
 *  ("Ravens win", the shape PL ships) while a site labels its segments in
 *  theirs ("Ravens"), so the pick is translated through `barPick` before it
 *  reaches the panel — exactly label matches pass through, a trailing " win"
 *  is dropped onto a matching segment, and anything unplaceable is returned
 *  unchanged so the bar fails closed (nothing accented) rather than accenting
 *  the nearest segment to a claim nobody made.

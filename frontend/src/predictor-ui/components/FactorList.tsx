/**
 * The "why it matters" rows: one per factor, each naming the market it is about.
 *
 * Three things this component is careful about, and each is a rule rather than a
 * preference:
 *
 * 1. **The direction is never carried by colour.** A drawn triangle and a word —
 *    "for the pick" / "against it" — so the meaning survives with no colour
 *    perception, no greyscale print and no stylesheet. The triangle is
 *    `aria-hidden` and the words are the accessible truth. A `neutral` factor
 *    draws neither: there is no direction to draw, and a mark in either
 *    direction would be one.
 * 2. **The marks are drawn, not borrowed.** The §7a mock uses ▲ and ▼, which are
 *    unicode characters standing in for an icon system: they render at the
 *    viewer's font, at the viewer's weight, and they are not a consistent set.
 *    These are two authored triangles on one 24-unit grid, so up and down are
 *    visibly the same mark turned over.
 * 3. **A row is a real button.** §13c links a factor to the figure it names, and
 *    the second half of every affordance in this panel is that it is operable by
 *    keyboard alone. That assertion is what catches a `div` with an `onClick`.

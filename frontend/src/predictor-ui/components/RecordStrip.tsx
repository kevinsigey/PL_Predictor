/**
 * The record strip: the two numbers the facts carry, and the proportion as
 * geometry.
 *
 * Spec §5a-bis, and this is the component that rule exists for. `record` is
 * `hits: 41, settled: 68`; the facts contain no `60.3`. So the text reads
 * `41/68` and the bar's width carries the proportion. Writing "60.3%" here would
 * be a third number this product invented by arithmetic on two real ones — the
 * same class of error as a model inventing a figure, and the reason the rule is
 * written down rather than left to whoever renders it.
 *
 * The accessible name says "41 of 68" for the same reason. A screen reader
 * cannot see a bar's width, so the numbers have to be in words; those words are
 * the facts' own, not a percentage derived from them.
 *
 * Optional `rebuilt` and `preTip` fields (NBA): when the headline record includes
 * picks made after the event started, `rebuilt` is the count of those picks and
 * `preTip` is the pre-tip subset. Both are rendered as honest disclosure lines.

  /* One reading of `record`, including the partial one, and the reason it is a
   * decision rather than a fall-out.
   *
   * `hits` and `settled` are two fields of ONE `record` object in the facts
   * bundle (`facts.py:29`; every fixture in the service's own tests carries both,
   * and `template.py:159` refuses to write a record row at all unless both are
   * there). So `hits: null, settled: 68` is not a record missing its numerator —
   * it is a record object this component cannot read, and the honest rendering
   * of "we cannot read this" is the dash, the same token `pct()` and
   * `fmt.record()` already use.
   *
   * **The trade-off, stated because it is real: this throws away a 68 the caller
   * did hand over, and `—/68` would show it.** Rejected, and the reason is the
   * same one that stops the bar being drawn 0% wide: `settled` comes out of the
   * very object whose `hits` we have just declined to trust, so quoting the
   * denominator while withholding the numerator asserts that one of the two is
   * sound when the only thing we know is that the object is not. There is also an
   * accessibility cost — "—/68" announces as "em dash slash sixty-eight", which
   * is exactly the run of glyphs the bar's own "41 of 68" accessible name exists
   * to avoid.
   *
   * What would change the ruling: the service emitting a partial record
   * deliberately, or the facts guaranteeing `settled` independently of `hits`.
   * Neither is true, so there is no partial here to be honest *about*, and the
   * dash is the whole of the truth. Pinned by a test rather than left to the
   * next reader of this file.

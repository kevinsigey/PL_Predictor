 *
 *  **Why the buttons are conditional, and why the condition is `onSegmentFocus`
 *  rather than a prop.** Those buttons have exactly one job — §13c's step
 *  through the figures, which reports a focus up to `onSegmentFocus` and gets a
 *  `highlightKey` highlight back. A `<button>` whose only handler is
 *  `onSegmentFocus?.()` with nothing passed is a control that is announced,
 *  reachable, and does nothing: a focus stop that lies. `MatchCard` was exactly
 *  that, and it was not a near-miss: a card cannot host §13c at all, because the
 *  other half of §13c is a `FactorList` and a card has no factors. So the card
 *  never passed `onSegmentFocus`, never will, and the buttons inside it were
 *  dead controls inside a `<button>` — invalid HTML a browser is entitled to
 *  stop making interactive, which is the same as saying a keyboard reader has
 *  stops that do nothing.
 *
 *  A prop would be a thing every call site has to remember, and here the default
 *  is what a call site that remembers nothing gets. Deriving the branch from a
 *  signal the component already receives makes the unsafe answer unreachable *for
 *  a caller that passes no listener*: a bar in a button with nothing to report gets
 *  plain text — valid HTML, no dead focus stop. A prop defaulting to interactive
 *  would fail in the other direction, into invalid HTML, on the call site that
 *  forgot.
 *
 *  **What it does not reach, and the one prop that does.** "Unreachable by
 *  accident" was this comment's claim, and it was too wide: a component cannot see
 *  its own ancestors, so nothing derived from `onSegmentFocus` can protect a
 *  caller who *does* pass a listener and renders the bar inside a control. That
 *  combination is `button > button` — measured, in `nesting.test.tsx`, with this
 *  very component — and `MatchCard` is protected from it only because a card has
 *  no factors and so never has a listener. `insideControl` is the one thing here a
 *  caller has to remember, and it is a real cost taken deliberately: the
 *  alternative is not "the default is safe", it is "the default is safe only for
 *  the call sites that happen to have nothing to report". There is no CSS answer
 *  either — a `<button>` is a `<button>` however its contents are styled.
 *
 *  **Nothing is withheld either way.** The figures are in this label and in the
 *  bar's accessible name above, so a reader who cannot step through them still
 *  has every one of them. What a non-interactive label gives up is a way to
 *  *arrive* at them one at a time, which is a duplicate of the affordance
 *  whatever surface the bar is on. The market row's disclosure is the same: it
 *  cannot exist inside a control at all, so the figures there stay open rather
 *  than being hidden behind a button the caller is not allowed to render. */

   *  the figures exist to fix.
   *
   *  **It stays opt-in, and a CSS-only replacement was considered and rejected.**
   *  The hazard is real and it is the one this component does not design out: a
   *  site that forgets this prop gets a `justify-between` row that collides at
   *  260px instead of the fallback, and the guard is remembering a prop rather
   *  than like `onSegmentFocus` (above) being derived from a signal already
   *  present. Three CSS answers were measured against the spec and each fails it:
   *
   *  - **`clamp()`** — ruled out by §6a, which sets a 12px floor and says the
   *    market row "does not get a smaller size to make a row fit, it drops the
   *    row". Both consuming sites enforce the floor in their own tests
   *    (`craft-floor.test.ts` in Sports_Predictor, `hub.test.mjs` in the Hub), so
   *    this is not a style preference with no teeth.
   *  - **A container query that hides the figures.** It fixes the collision, but
   *    CSS cannot add the control that brings them back, so on a narrow surface it
   *    withholds data with no way to reach it — the failure §13c's closing
   *    constraint is written about. The disclosure has to be a real element, which
   *    is the whole reason the fallback is a button and not a `hidden` attribute.
   *  - **A container query that reflows instead** (`flex-wrap`, or the cells
   *    stacking). Nothing is hidden, so nothing is withheld, and the 12px floor
   *    holds. But it breaks the one thing the row exists for: spec §6 item 3 says
   *    each figure sits "in the column of the figure it is being compared with",
   *    and a wrapped row puts two outcomes on one line and one on the next, so the
   *    comparison stops lining up. At 260px with three outcomes there is no layout
   *    that keeps three 12px figures in three columns; something has to give, and
   *    §13c item 4 already chose what.
   *
   *  So the cost is a prop to remember, and the compensation is that the default
   *  is the *safe* one: off means the figures are shown, which is a row that reads
   *  well and a site that has not yet discovered it is narrow. The failure mode of
   *  forgetting is a collision at 260px — a layout defect a screenshot catches —
   *  and not withheld text, a dead control, or a claim. The rule stays where §13c
   *  item 4 put it, and this is the note so the next person does not re-open it
   *  without measuring first. */

/**
 * `Signal[]` as the facts block renders it: one compact row per finding, a
 * headline of at most 12 words, and a collapsed evidence line a keyboard can
 * open.
 *
 * Spec `2026-10-01-fixture-signals-design.md` §3 (the contract), §6 (the look).
 * The type below is §3 **verbatim in field and meaning**; everything after it is
 * this component's own account of what the fields may not be used to do.
 *
 * ## The one rule everything else serves
 *
 * **A figure may only reach the page if the same figure is in the row's own
 * words.** A signal is code-computed (spec §2: "Code computes the insight; the
 * AI only chooses and words it"), so the temptation is to let the visual carry a
 * number the headline does not mention — a bar 74% wide under words that never
 * said 74%. That is the "the model supplies words and ordering, never a number
 * the panel renders" rule from explainer-v2, one level up, and it is why
 * `headline` is **two** fields and not one:
 *
 *   - `headline.text` — the one line a reader reads, at most 12 words.
 *   - `headline.figures` — the numbers the visual draws.
 *
 * They are separate so the two can disagree, and `signalIsDrawn` is where that
 * disagreement is caught: **every render path checks that the figure the visual
 * draws appears in the headline's words, and refuses the row when it does not**
 * (`HeadlineFigureMismatchError` — see `assertFigureIsStated`).
 *
 * "Appears in the words" is decided by comparing NUMBERS, not by comparing words
 * or strings — `headlineStatesFigure`, and the long history of why that is not a
 * detail is on `STATED_FIGURE`. The three ways a figure can be stated wrongly
 * that a string comparison gets wrong, each found by review against this code:
 * `1%` is not `61%`; `<1%` is not `1%`; and `−1.6` is not `+1.6`.
 *
 * Merging the two into one formatted string was considered and rejected: a
 * component that *parsed* its own headline to find the figure would make the
 * assertion vacuous — the number on the chip and the number in the sentence would
 * be the same string by construction, so "they are equal" would hold for every
 * possible implementation, including a wrong one.
 *
 * **THAT ENFORCEMENT WAS MISSING, and it was missing in the place this file's
 * own header describes.** The first version promised the rule above and enforced
 * it only on the clipping path: `clipHeadline` returns any headline of 12 words or
 * fewer unchanged, so those rows were never compared against `headline.figures`
 * at all. CodeRabbit caught it against the vendored copy in F1
 * (`F1_Predictor#31`, comment `4172144009`) — "Backed by 61% of 30 picks" beside a
 * drawn 74%. That is the defect the split `headline` exists to make impossible,
 * reintroduced through the one branch that did not look. The test that should
 * have caught it did the opposite: it rendered a deliberately mismatched headline
 * and asserted the bar came out at 73.8%, which recorded the defect as expected
 * behaviour. A test that proves a thing is broken is not the same as a test that
 * catches it breaking, and this one was the former.
 *
 * ## What this component refuses, and why
 *
 * Three refusals, all of the same kind: a mistake a caller can make that would
 * otherwise reach the page as a *false statement* rather than as an error.
 *
 *  1. **A rate outside [0, 1]** (`SignalFigureError`). The "9600%" defect in
 *     this contract's clothes: `figures.rate` is a share, and a yardage figure
 *     read as one draws a bar that runs off its own track.
 *  2. **A figure the visual needs and the row does not carry**
 *     (`SignalFigureError`). A `reliability_bar` with no `figures.rate` would
 *     draw an empty track, and an empty track reads as 0%.
 *  3. **A visual this package cannot draw** (`UndrawableSignalVisualError`).
 *     Phase 1 drew `delta_chip` and `reliability_bar`; `absence_strip` joined them with
 *     the phase-2 absence signal. `projected_vs_actual` (phase 3) is still refused rather than rendered
 *     without their marker, which is the one failure mode that both tests and
 *     screenshots miss.
 *  4. **A headline that does not state the figure its visual draws**
 *     (`HeadlineFigureMismatchError`). See `assertFigureIsStated`.
 *
 * ## What this component drops rather than refuses
 *
 * **A rate whose `n` is under the floor.** Spec §4: "Renders only at n >= 30;
 * below that the row says nothing, never a rate from a handful of games." So
 * the whole row goes, not just the rate — a headline reading "has been right
 * 74% of the time" with the bar and the `n` taken away is a worse row than no
 * row. `n: null` on a rate-drawing row is dropped for the same reason and is
 * **not** a special case of the arithmetic: there is no count, so there is
 * nothing that could have cleared a floor.
 *
 * ## Rejected: ranking and capping here
 *
 * Spec §2 puts the fixed rule in the signals layer — "a fixed rule (not the
 * model) ranks them by `strength` and keeps the top 2-3" — and the plan puts it
 * on the endpoint (`GET /signals/{game_id}` returns the top 3 by `strength`).
 * `PicksList` sets the opposite precedent and caps three rows per category
 * inside the component, because that is where it draws the rank numbers and
 * where a caller had already broken the rule. Neither transfers here. A
 * `SignalRows` row draws no position, so a cap in this component would silently
 * drop a row the endpoint ranked into its top three for a reason this component
 * cannot see, and a second copy of the ranking rule is a second rule — the
 * argument `scripts/ui-package.mjs` is written on. Rows render in the order they
 * arrive, and a test pins that.

 *  - `4171902960` / `4171924918`: normalising one side only let `<1%` stop

 *  - `4172215626`: normalising BOTH sides discarded the boundary symbol, so a

 *    rate the bar does not draw.
 *  - `4172215627`: whitespace splitting left `74%—based` as one token, so a

 *
 * Stripping punctuation off words cannot fix the last two and causes the third:
 * the boundary and the sign are *inside* the number, and a figure can be glued to
 * a word by an em dash without either of them being altered. So the text is
 * scanned for numbers and each is read whole, and the unit of comparison is the
 * NUMBER rather than the word. `1%` can no longer satisfy `61%` because the
 * scanner yields `61`, not `1`.
 *
 * Non-figure text is simply not matched and is therefore ignored, which is what
 * lets "Right 74%—based on 42 games" pass and "42 games" alone not count.
 *
 * **The sign is `+`, U+2212 or a hyphen-minus, and it is glued to its digits.**
 * An en dash and an em dash are typography, not arithmetic: with either in the
 * class, "a 5—3 record" parsed as a negative three and "a — 42 point swing"
 * parsed as −42, so a correct headline was refused because the figure it plainly
 * stated had been read with a sign nobody wrote. Removing them costs nothing —
 * no writer types an em dash to mean minus — and `\s*` between sign and digits
 * goes with them, because a spaced hyphen is a dash in prose ("Right — 74%"),
 * not a negative. The remaining three marks are unambiguous and always sit
 * against the number: `+1.6`, `−1.6`, `-1.6`.

 *    between them is a figure the bar does not draw. See the branch for why
 *    floating-point arithmetic cannot supply them and why `74.4%` is not a near
 *    miss of `74%`.
 *  - **A stated boundary must be TRUE OF THE DRAWN RATE.** The chip's `<1%` and

 *    headline claiming `1%` states a rate the bar does not draw and is refused

 *    **The test is truth, not equality with the drawn bound** — a rate of 0.004

 *    the defect this file exists to prevent is a headline stating something
 *    untrue of the drawn figure, and an over-tight rule manufactures exactly that
 *    by rejecting what is merely more precise than the display's granularity.

 *    are refused earlier on the domain, where `drawn.pct` is known, so they never
 *    reach the comparator branches at all.
 *  - **A stated sign must agree with the drawn one, for a gap.** The chip reads
 *    `+1.6`; a headline saying `−1.6` is claiming the opposite direction and is
 *    refused (4172215630). An UNSIGNED `1.6` is accepted, because a chip figure

 * the cost is stated here because it is real: a throw takes the whole list down,
 * so one adapter that mis-states a figure takes out every other signal on that
 * fixture's page.
 *
 * It throws anyway, for three reasons, and the third is the one that settles it.
 *
 *  1. **The precedent is two-for-two in this package.** `RowKindMismatchError` and
 *     `OutPlayerInRankingError` in `PicksList.tsx` both throw, for the same shape
 *     of mistake: a caller passed something the component must not draw. A third
 *     component answering the same question differently would mean a caller had
 *     to learn which rule applied where.
 *  2. **The bug is in the CALLER, and the caller has tests.** An adapter that
 *     writes "61%" beside `figures.rate = 0.74` is broken, and it is broken in
 *     that adapter's own suite before it reaches a reader. Throwing is what puts
 *     the failure in front of whoever can fix it, which is the adapter's author,
 *     and it names the game and both readings.
 *  3. **Dropping the headline does not degrade quietly — it degrades to the very
 *     thing the rule forbids.** A row whose bar draws 74% with no words beside it
 *     is a bare number with no claim attached and no sample size in words. The
 *     reader cannot tell a 74% from a 61% because neither is on the page. That is
 *     not a lesser version of the defect; it is the same reader-facing outcome
 *     with the part that made the number checkable removed. The only reason
 *     dropping would be better is that the page survives — and a page that loses
 *     a row because an author made a typo is a page that ships the typo's
 *     consequence silently, which is the failure mode every refusal in this file
 *     exists to avoid.
 *
 * **A throw in a shared UI is recoverable**, because this family already renders
 * failures: `States.tsx`'s `ErrorState` is a `role="alert"` with a retry, and
 * `ExplainerPanel` uses it. A site that would rather lose the row can catch this
 * at its own boundary; what it must not do is catch it and render the figure
 * beside words that disagree with it.
 *
 * **What it cannot catch, stated rather than implied.** This checks that the
 * figure appears, not that the sentence is *true*. A headline saying "the model
 * has been right 74% of the time" with `figures.rate = 0.74` passes, and that
 * sentence is the adapter's claim about what the number means. Nothing in a
 * renderer can check that; it is the adapter's own test, and it is the reason
 * `figures` and `text` are both in the payload rather than one derived from the

/**
 * Clip a headline to `max` words, and say whether it was.

 * **The rule: count whitespace-delimited words, keep the first `max`, and mark

 * is what fits on one line — "−4.5:" is one word to a reader and two to a
 * tokenizer that also splits on punctuation.
 *
 * **Why clipping and not refusing, when a wrong number is not acceptable.**
 * Because clipping removes *words* and never edits a *figure*. The figures this
 * component draws come from `headline.figures`, which clipping does not touch,
 * so a clipped row still shows exactly the numbers it claims and loses only
 * prose — and the sample size survives regardless, because `n` is on the evidence
 * line whether or not the headline is clipped. A refused row, by contrast, loses
 * its whole finding because an adapter miscounted a word, which is a worse
 * outcome than a shorter sentence and a `data-clipped="true"` in the DOM.
 *
 * **A drawn figure is PROTECTED, and this was a real defect until it was.**
 * The first version claimed a clip "cannot corrupt a figure" on the grounds that
 * the figures are not in the text this function rewrites. That was wrong, and
 * CodeRabbit review comment 4171773475 caught it: the headline *does* speak them
 * — that is the whole honesty rule above — and "was right 74% of the time" can
 * sit at word 14. Clipping to 12 then left a bar at 74% under a sentence that no
 * longer mentioned 74%: exactly the dishonesty the split `headline` exists to
 * make impossible, reintroduced by the cap.
 *
 * So the rule is now: **keep the first `max` ORDINARY words, plus every word the
 * drawn figure occupies, in document order.**
 *
 * **Protection is a RANGE of character offsets, supplied by the caller, and this
 * is the third interface this question has had.** That history is worth keeping
 * because each shape failed in the same direction — it could say WHETHER the
 * figure was stated but not WHICH WORDS to keep:
 *
 *  - a `protectedWords: string[]`, matched by stripping punctuation off each
 *    word. Substring matching let `1%` satisfy `61%` (4171835614); normalising one
 *    side only let `<1%` stop matching itself (4171902960, 4171924918); stripping
 *    both threw the boundary away so `1%` satisfied `<1%` (4172215626); and
 *    splitting on whitespace left `74%—based` unrecognised so a headline plainly
 *    stating `74%` was clipped away (4172215627). Root cause of all four: the unit
 *    was the WORD, and a figure is not a word.
 *  - a PREDICATE over spans of up to three words, which fixed the straddling case
 *    but could not say which words the figure covered — so the clipper asked about
 *    prefixes of itself and kept `b c 74%` whole (4172337760), and a scan that
 *    resumed one word at a time re-found the same figure and printed it twice.
 *
 * A range says exactly which characters are the figure, so the clipper keeps the
 * words those characters sit in and re-derives nothing. It is built by
 * `figureRange` from the same `denotes` the validator uses, which is what makes
 * the two halves of this rule one rule: the validator asks "does the headline
 * state the figure at all", the clipper asks "which words is it".
 *
 * **And the figure being protected must be one the headline actually stated.**
 * `signalIsDrawn` → `assertFigureIsStated` runs first, so the range is never null
 * for a row that reaches the screen: a row whose words omit the figure is refused
 * rather than clipped.
 *
 * **Where the cap sits.** The cap is on the sentence AROUND the figure, so a
 * clipped row can exceed `max` words, and a headline that names its figure on
 * every one of forty words stays forty words long. That is an adapter copy bug
 * with an adapter fix, and `data-clipped` is the signal for it. The words BESIDE a
 * protected figure are ordinary and spend the budget like any other — pinned by a
 * test, because an earlier interface swept them in.

          * cannot mean all three are behind the control. This reads it as: the
          * line carries all three, and what collapses is the LONG one. `source`
          * is a free string from another repository ("stored pre-kickoff picks,
          * 0.5-0.6 bucket") and is the field that makes a row two or three lines
          * deep at 390px; `n` and a formatted date are short and cost one line.
          * So `n` and the date sit in the collapsed row and `source` is what the
          * button reveals. A reading where all three hide was rejected: it makes
          * the sample size unavailable without a pointer's worth of interaction
          * on the exact claim a reader most wants to check. */}

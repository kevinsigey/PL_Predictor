/** Parsing of the flow bundle that both the instant block and the flow need.
 *
 *  The bundle shape differs per site (PL names `team_home`/`pick` as a string,
 *  Sports names `home_team`/`pick` as an object, F1 names a `driver`). These
 *  four helpers are the ONE place that knows those differences, so the block
 *  and the flow cannot disagree about what the bundle says — the failure mode
 *  that produced 68 on one part of a page and 72 on another.
 *
 *  Nothing here derives a probability: a bundle without a pick probability
 *  yields null, and the caller renders nothing rather than a number nobody
 *  stored.

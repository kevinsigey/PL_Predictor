              kickoff" describes WHEN the pick was made, which is what this
              state now is. The old wording described the pick's standing in the
              record, and under the 2026-10-01 reversal a pick made after the
              start is counted like any other, so that standing is no longer the
              thing worth saying. The `rebuilt` PROP is kept: it is a published
              field name, and renaming it would break every call site to change

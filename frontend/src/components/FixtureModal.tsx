    /* THE BARE HEADING, and why the sides are spelled two ways here.
       Measured per state by rendering the modal and dumping the flow's rows,
       not by reading a screenshot:

         - pre-game — the flow's ONLY row was the fixture's own name, rendered
                      as an `H4`, so the live modal showed `Tottenham vs Aston
                      Villa` with nothing under it, directly above the AI button.
         - in-play  — `FixtureDetail` has no live score, so a kicked-off fixture
                      with no `post_match` yet takes this same branch and
                      rendered the SAME bare heading.
         - finished — TWO real sentences (the result, and the pick's rightness).
                      Live content, and it stays.

       So this is not a deletion of the flow; it is the heading made conditional
       on rows existing beneath it, expressed in the only place a site may
       express it -- the bundle it hands over, because `predictor-ui/` is
       vendored and must not change.

       `FixtureFlow` reads the sides under `home_team`/`away_team` for BOTH its
       pre-game name row and its finished result sentence, so one spelling
       cannot suppress the first without breaking the second. `bundleFacts` --
       the single place the block's verdict sentence goes through -- reads
       `home_team ?? team_home`, and both spellings are that package's own
       documented contract. So:

         - ALWAYS carry `team_home`/`team_away`, which `fullTeamName` reads to
           resolve the pick's label to a side. Without it the block would fall
           back to nothing and "Tottenham is the pick." would be lost.
         - carry `home_team`/`away_team` ONLY once a result makes a sentence
           that needs them. Pre-game there is no such sentence, and withholding
           the keys the name row reads is what makes that row impossible rather
           than merely unlikely.

       The block's figures depend on neither key: `panelFacts` above is handed
       this site's own fixture, not the bundle, so the tiles and the bar are
       identical either way. */

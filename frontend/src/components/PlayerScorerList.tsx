// per-player ledger were all true and all removed: they are what a reader does
// not need in order to act on "Saliba, Arsenal, 31% chance of scoring".

 * which drops it. If a status is added to that set, this must be updated with it.
 *
 * "d" (doubtful) is deliberately absent: `availability_multiplier` returns

 * this list still needs to make per row, because a row is now the player, the
 * team and the prediction:
 *
 *  - ARM (`Poisson 1 − e^−λ, uncalibrated`). The goal and assist arms are
 *    `anytime_probability`, bare `1 - exp(-lambda)` Poisson
 *    (`player_goals.py`), and nothing calibrates them. This is why the
 *    50/50-blended `anytime_goal_contribution_prob` is still NOT a category
 *    here: a blend of one calibrated and one uncalibrated estimator is
 *    neither. That decision is unchanged -- only the sentence per row went.
 *  - LEDGER (`no graded record per player …`). `tracking.store
 *    .get_scorer_accuracy()` returns `{snapshot, reconstructed}` -- aggregate
 *    groups with no player key -- so there was never a per-player record to
 *    quote and never a hit rate that belonged on a named row.
 *  - FORM / LINEUP. `features/player_form.blended_current_form` names which
 *    blend it used ("current", "prior_season", "position_avg", "none"). Both
 *    the cold-start ranking and the doubtful-player rule below still hold; the

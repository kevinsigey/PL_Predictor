// A PRE-KICKOFF tally, and it says so: `RoundNavigator` renders this as
// "X/Y picks made before kickoff correct", which is exactly what it is. It is
// NOT the track record's headline — since the 2026-10-01 reversal that headline
// counts every recorded pick, whenever it was made (see
// `TrackRecordPanel.tsx`).
//
// The filter reads `made_before_kickoff`, which the backend DERIVES per read by
// comparing each pick's own `snapshotted_at` to its fixture's kickoff as UTC
// instants (`tracking/store.py::_made_before_kickoff`) — the same derivation the
// track record's `pre_kickoff.n_resolved_fixtures` and `/facts`'s
// `pick_timing` use. It used to read `!f.backfilled`, which is a different
// question with the same-looking answer: `backfilled` is a provenance flag
// ("this row came from the backfill job") whose writer takes it as an argument,
// so a pick captured by the five-minute tick AFTER its own kickoff is labelled
// live-captured. Two surfaces, two definitions of "before kickoff", one
// product.
//
// Picks recorded after their own kickoff are still listed on their cards (with
// the moment badge) and are still counted in the record; they are simply not in
// this particular figure. A payload that omits the field entirely — an older
// baked snapshot — contributes nothing here, which is the fail-closed
// direction: the label is withheld, never invented.

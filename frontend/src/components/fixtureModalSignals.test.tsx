/**
 * PL's fixture modal fetches and renders its `absence` row — the last hop.
 *
 * The backend shipped in cbb289c2, the component can draw the visual (hub #83),
 * and nothing between them existed: no client method, no fetch, no mount. This is
 * that hop, and deliberately the same shape as Sports' `GameDetailModal`, so
 * "a fixture page shows its signals" is one implementation and not one per sport.
 *
 * ## EVERY failure is silence, and the failures are indistinguishable
 *
 * A missing route, a 404, a network error and an honest empty list all leave `[]`.
 * Not laziness — spec §2's "no data, no row" forbids a placeholder, and a signal is
 * an *enhancement* on this page: it must never become the page's error state.
 *
 * ## Why a finished gameweek is not asked about
 *
 * `/api/signals/{event_id}` answers `[]` for one, because `facts.game_context`
 * empties the player pool once a fixture is live or final — the squad list it holds
 * is the one known BEFORE kick-off. `post_match` is `null` on an upcoming fixture
 * and an object on a finished one, so `post_match` is the flag, not a truthiness
 * test on some other field.
 *
 * The `FixtureDetail` fixture is the real shape from `FixtureModal.instant.test.tsx`
 * rather than a minimal object, because `panelFacts` indexes `home_context` and
 * `ScorelineHeatmap` indexes `grid[0]` unconditionally: a thin fixture throws
 * before the row is ever reached, and a test that dies in setup tests nothing.

/**
 * The reviewer's Phase-1 live follow-ups for PL, measured rather than eyeballed.
 *
 * 1. **A bare heading with nothing under it.** `FixtureFlow`'s pre-game row is
 *    the fixture's own name and nothing else, so before kickoff it rendered an
 *    `H4` reading `Tottenham vs Aston Villa` with no sentence beneath it,
 *    directly above the AI button. Measured per state, not assumed:
 *
 *      pre-game  — ONE row, and it is that heading. Nothing under it.
 *      in-play   — `FixtureDetail` carries no live score (its only score is
 *                  `post_match.final_score`), so a fixture that has kicked off
 *                  but has no `post_match` yet takes the SAME pre-game branch
 *                  and renders the SAME bare heading. Measured, not assumed.
 *      finished  — one real sentence (the result). The pick's rightness is the
 *                  headline's job, said once as "Called it: …" / "Missed: …".
 *
 *    So this is NOT a blanket deletion of the flow. It is a heading that is
 *    conditional on rows existing beneath it, and the per-state behaviour is
 *    asserted here rather than checked by looking.
 *
 * 2. **One figure, one place.** The audit below is a field-by-field count of
 *    every figure-shaped token on the rendered modal, split by whether it sits
 *    inside the instant block or outside it. MEASURED RESULT: no figure is
 *    printed in both places, so nothing is deleted for 1b. PL's own Phase 1
 *    already removed the market bars (see the comment above the scoreline
 *    section in `FixtureModal.tsx`), which is why this repo measures clean
 *    where NBA's did not. The audit is pinned as assertions so a later change
 *    that reintroduces a second copy fails here instead of shipping.

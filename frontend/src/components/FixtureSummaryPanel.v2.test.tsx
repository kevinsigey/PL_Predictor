/** The v2 panel as this site actually ships it: a real answer from the real
 *  service, through the real component, over the real fixture.
 *
 *  Everything asserted here is asserted on the RENDERED result — the background
 *  colour the browser would paint a segment, and the accessible name a screen
 *  reader would read — and never on a prop having been passed. A prop assertion
 *  is satisfied by a site that hands the panel a pick it cannot use, and that is
 *  precisely the shape of the defect this file exists to catch.
 *
 *  **The defect, in the shape it actually takes on this site.** The bar joins the
 *  pick to a segment BY LABEL. PL's `/facts` names the pick `"<team> win"`
 *  (`match_pick` in the PL API's facts module) and this site labels its segments
 *  with bare team names, so a home or away pick matched nothing and the bar
 *  rendered with no accented segment at all. That is the panel's *correct*
 *  rendering of a bundle with no pick, printed directly beneath a verdict
 *  sentence naming one. It type-checked, it built, and every other test in this
 *  repo passed while it shipped.

/** Which side this fixture's pick IS, and the label the bar's segments use.
 *
 *  **A reviewed fixture's pick is the review's side**, and `predicted_result` is
 *  only the fallback for a fixture with no review at all. The two are not the
 *  same field: `predicted_result` is the DISPLAY variant, where the scoreline
 *  model promotes a draw when it and the percentage model agree one is likely,
 *  and the backend labels it informational only — never used to score accuracy
 *  (`api/schemas.py::_fill_predicted_result`). Measured on the shipped snapshot
 *  the display variant disagrees with the review's side on 17 of the 20 finished
 *  fixtures whose shots fields are present, and on 229 of the 330 unreviewed
 *  rows the review cannot contradict because there is no review.
 *
 *  So the review is read FIRST: it is the pick the review row, the list card and
 *  the track record all mean, and a block that named the other one would put three
 *  different picks on one page. It is also the ONLY source for the 30 finished
 *  fixtures baked into the public snapshot without `predicted_result` at all, so
 *  dropping it in favour of the display variant would leave those rows with no
 *  pick to state.
 *
 *  `label` is the SEGMENTS' vocabulary, not prose: the shared `panelFacts`
 *  adapter labels the three segments `team_home`, `team_away` and `"Draw"`, and
 *  the bar joins the pick to a segment by exact label match. A label worded any
 *  other way — `"Arsenal win"`, which is what `matchPick` returns for the card —
 *  joins to nothing and renders a bar with no accent at all. A pick is returned
 *  only when its side actually carries a probability, so a side with no
 *  probability names no pick and there is no segment for one to fail to find.
 *
 *  Returned as one value rather than read by the caller, because the rule has
 *  three sources and two fallbacks and a caller re-deriving any part of it is how
 *  this went wrong the first time. */
